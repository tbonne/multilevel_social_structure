Memory keeps you at home and within a social group: a mechanistic movement model of social network emergence
--------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:    While the development of social systems has been attributed to both the physical environment and behavioural characteristics of a species, it is unknown to what extent they interact to produce emergent social structures. To model the development of social structures we extend an existing cognitive movement model to allow for social interactions. We use this cognitive movement model to quantify the variation within spatial and social phenotypes that emerge for a typical social forager. We then alter the distribution of resources, individual metabolisms, the magnitude of juvenile induction, and tested predictions about the impacts of these alterations on spatial and social phenotypes. We found that most of our predictions were not supported: individual differences in metabolism and patchier landscapes did not lead to increased individual differences in spatial or social phenotypes. We did, however, find that when juvenile induction was increased, consistent individual differences in spatial phenotypes did increase, but not for social phenotypes. We suggest that cognitive movement models, where learning is directly incorporated into movement and social behaviours, can provide a needed aid to intuition, help interpret empirical results, and drive theoretical developments at the spatial-social interface.
