Memory keeps you at home and within a social group: a mechanistic movement model of the emergence of social structures
--------------------------------------------------------

Abstract:    While the development of social systems has been attributed to both the physical environment and behavioural characteristics of a species, it is unknown to what extent they interact to produce emergent social structures. To model the development of social structures we use an existing movement model, which utilizes a biologically inspired two-part memory model to allow individuals to learn a home range. We extend this movement model to allow individuals to also learn about social partners. We employ this extended movement model and manipulate the foragers resource landscape, to then evaluated the consequences of these modifications on emergent spatial and social phenotypes. We found that memory was sufficient to generate home ranges and stable social groups, and that consistent individual differences in our simulated populations were highest with slow decay in memory and landscapes with heterogenous distributions of resources. Additionally, we found the highest correlations between spatial-social phenotypes occurred in homogenous resource landscapes and slow memory decay. We suggest that including a learning component in movement models can provide a needed aid to intuition, help interpret empirical results, and drive theoretical developments at the spatial-social interface where spatial and social processes are inextricably linked.
